# What is this?

Each session, a topic is presented.  The presenter will spend 15 - 30 minutes talking through, or demonstrating a subject.

The attendees will then be given a task to complete on the presented subject.

Following this, the presenter demonstrates a possible solution to the task.

# For example ... ?

Let's imagine that we have a session on RavenDB.  The presenter spends 10 minutes talking about Raven, and gives a quick demo for 10 minutes.  They then set a task for people to create a .Net console application that reads and writes phone numbers to Raven.  The presenter will stick around, and answer questions throughout the session.

# I want to attend, what should I do?

Check the description of the meetup - that will cover any prior knowledge or experience and where that can be obtained.  It will also describe the subject being covered, and the task to be completed.

# I want to be a presenter - what do I need to do?

Great!  Decide on a subject and prepare a 15 - 30 minute talk.  Following the talk, decide on a task that uses the things covered in the talk: the task can be open ended or specific - but it should be simple.  You'll then be expected to demonstrate a solution to the task.

Ideally, attendees will require no prior ability, but if there are any pre-requisites then they will need to be declared.

# I have an idea for a session that I'd like to see.

That's good - send them to me, and I'll try and find people to cover them.

# How long will this all take?

The talk itself will be limited to 30 mins max.  
The task will be limited to 1 hour.
Following this, there will be a demo of a solution to the task by the presenter (no more than 30 mins - although likely less).
That's 2 hours max.

# What language will this be in?

There are no prescriptive languages, but it's likely that the presenter will favour a given language.

# I'd like to attend with a friend and complete the task together - is that okay?

Sure.

# How does this all work?

We'll run a Zoom call for the full session.  After the initial talk, people can drop in and out until the end, where we'll get back together and see a walk-through of one possible solution to the task by the presenter.
